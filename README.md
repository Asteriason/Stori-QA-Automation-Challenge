# Automated Testing Framework

## Overview
This framework is built using Selenium and Python to perform automated end-to-end testing. It is designed to test web applications with ease, providing features like dynamic locators, screenshot capturing, and test reporting with `pytest-html`.

## Prerequisites

### Python Installation
- Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed
- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Dependencies
Install required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required libraries:
- selenium
- pytest
- pytest-html

### WebDriver
- Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)
- Add the WebDriver executable to your system PATH or place it in the root of the project

## Project Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ locators/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ locators.py         # Contains all element locators
â”œâ”€â”€ utilities/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ actions.py          # Core utility methods for interactions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ environment.py      # Browser setup
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_cases.py       # Test cases for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ screenshots/            # Folder for screenshots (auto-generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/                # HTML reports generated by pytest-html
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_data.csv       # Test data for the test cases
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ pytest.ini              # Pytest configuration
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure the WebDriver is set up correctly

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
Execute all test cases with:
```bash
pytest --html=reports/report.html
```

### View the Report
The test execution generates an HTML report in the `reports/` directory. Open it in a browser to view detailed results.

## Features

### Dynamic Locators
Locators are centralized in `locators/locators.py` for reusability and easy maintenance.

Example:
```python
SUGGESTION_COUNTRY_TEMPLATE = "//li[@class='ui-menu-item']//div[text()='{}']"
```

### Reusable Actions
Utility methods in `utilities/actions.py` handle common actions like clicking, dropdown selection, and screenshot capturing.

### Screenshots
- Automatically captured for failed tests
- Saved in the `screenshots/` folder
- Embedded in the HTML report for easy debugging

### Test Data-Driven
The framework uses data-driven tests from CSV files located in the `data/` directory.

### HTML Reports
Generates detailed HTML reports with test results, logs, and screenshots using pytest-html.

## Customizing Tests

### Adding a New Test Case
1. Create a new Python file in the `tests/` folder or add a new function to `test_cases.py`
2. Use `actions.py` methods to perform interactions:

```python
def test_new_feature(actions, data):
    actions.open_url("https://example.com")
    actions.enter_text("//input[@id='username']", "test_user")
    actions.click_element("//button[@id='login']")
```

### Adding New Locators
Add locators to `locators/locators.py` with a meaningful name:
```python
LOGIN_BUTTON = "//button[@id='login']"
```

### Updating Test Data
Update or add new data to `data/test_data.csv` to drive tests dynamically.

## Debugging

### Logs
Check the console logs during test execution for detailed debug information.

### Screenshots
Inspect screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder for any visual verification.

## Common Issues
- Ensure WebDriver compatibility with your browser version
- Validate locators using browser developer tools

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
